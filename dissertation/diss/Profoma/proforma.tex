\section*{Original Aims of the Project}
The aim of this project is to investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of a programmable data plane in application to Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) congestion control. More specifically, I aim to design, implement and evaluate a programmable switch to recover from TCP packetÂ losses that are not due to congestion. The implementation will be evaluated based on a series of tests, including both software and hardware simulations. A performance evaluation will also be provided.  

\section*{Work Completed}
Almost all my success criteria were met, with the exception of demonstrating the interoperability of my implementation with a software-based client/application. The architecture was designed, then implemented in P4. The implementation was tested via three different simulations: SDNet simulation, SUME simulation and hardware simulation. A performance evaluation of the design was provided. Two of the extensions were also completed. 

\section*{Special Difficulties}
The implementation stage of the architecture took longer than anticipated due to limitations of SDNet and the P4$\rightarrow$NetFPGA workflow. The current P4$\rightarrow$NetFPGA only supports header processing, without deep packet inspection, while this project used programmable buffering logic, which would require the ability to buffer packets. Hence, the design could not be fully expressed in P4 alone. To circumvent this, I had to learn to use Verilog in order to design a different architecture by adding additional HDL modules into the framework that allow packet buffering.
