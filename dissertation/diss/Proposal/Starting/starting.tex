\section*{\fontsize{18pt}{0.5}\selectfont Starting Point}

\subsection*{Platform \& Language}
This project will work mainly with a NetFPGA SUME board \cite{netfpgasume}, using P4 programming language. I will be using the P4-NetFPGA workflow, which provides infrastructure to compile P4 programs to NetFPGA \cite{fpga}. Apart from that, everything else will be built from scratch.

I have no prior experience with either NetFPGA or P4, but this will be mitigated through self-learning in which I will make use of the online tutorials, Google's resources and the P4 community documentation, as well as the experience of my supervisors. 

\subsection*{Computer Science Tripos}
The relevant Tripos courses that can serve as a starting point for this project are primarily: \emph{Computer Networking}, \emph{Principles of Communications} and \emph{ECAD and Architecture Practical Classes}. Since the courses are introductory, I will also consult Part III's \emph{High Performance Networking} course. I also plan to bridge any knowledge gap through extensive personal reading as well as help from my project supervisor.
