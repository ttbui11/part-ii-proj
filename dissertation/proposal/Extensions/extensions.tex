\section*{\fontsize{18pt}{1}\selectfont Possible Extensions}

If the core parts of the project are successful and completed within a reasonable time, I shall then try to investigate and implement further extensions. Some possible options are:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Supporting more than a single flow, and supporting the configuration of flows to monitor (\& retransmit)
	
	\item Supporting different packet sizes (depends on workflow limitations).
	
	\item Sending a notification to the source if multiple retransmits fail.
	
	\item Adaptively installing and deleting from the list of flows to monitor.
	
	\item A performance evaluation comparison to existing TCP recovery mechanisms.
\end{enumerate}
