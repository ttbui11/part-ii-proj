For this project I will be using my own computer, a 2017 MacBook Pro with a 2.3 GHz Intel Core i5 processor and 16 GB of RAM, that runs macOS Mojave. I accept full responsiblity for this machine, and I have made contingency plans to deal with hardware and/or software failures. Should that machine suddenly fail, I have another 16Gb of RAM computer with a 2.6 GHz Intel Core i7 processor that runs Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. If all else fails, I can continue to work on an MCS machine. Backups will be done weekly to Microsoft OneDrive and my external hardrive, and all my codes will be uploaded to GitHub for version control. 

For the hardware prototype, I will require a NetFPGA SUME board. I will need access to a machine that has the SUME installed, and a 10G NIC. These will be supplied by my supervisor. I will be using my own machine for development, with remote access to a server with the SUME board inside.

I will also require access to the lab network in order to \emph{ssh} to the server with the SUME board. Development on my machine will require VPN access, for using floating licenses of the development tools. Lastly, I will require a second server for testing some of the extensions of the project.
