\section*{\fontsize{18pt}{1}\selectfont Success Criteria}

This project will be deemed a success if I managed to study and design an architecture for the application, as well as succeeded to implement that design. More concretely:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item I have an implementation of the application written in P4.
	
	\item The implementation works in simulation (using bmv2/Xilinx simulators).
	
	\item I have a working prototype. In other words, my design runs on the hardware.
	
	\item I am able to demonstrate interoperability with a software-based client/application.
	
	\item I can provide a performance evaluation of the design.
\end{enumerate}
